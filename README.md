# Project Zoo

## Goal: 
Classify something as Rhino or Elephant

## Main tasks:
- Setup environment, likely Vagrant.
- Figure out the interface to use for non-technical users
- Figure out a way to package the final solution


- Is there an out of the box classifier I can use (for example, ImageNet stuff)?
- Is there an out of the box topology I can use?
- Can I create my own topology?
